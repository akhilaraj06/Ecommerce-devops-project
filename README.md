# 🪐 Astronomy Shop – DevOps Observability Demo

This is my fork and implementation of the **Astronomy Shop** demo, adapted from the OpenTelemetry demo project.  
It demonstrates a **microservice-based application** with a full observability stack, implemented as a hands-on DevOps learning project.

---

## 🔹 Project Purpose

- Practice **DevOps skills**: CI/CD, containerization, orchestration, monitoring.
- Implement **observability** using OpenTelemetry across microservices.
- Deploy services using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Multi-service **microservice architecture** simulating an online shop.
- **End-to-end observability**: tracing, metrics, and logs via OpenTelemetry.
- **Dockerized services** for quick local setup.
- **Kubernetes manifests** for cluster deployment.
- **Monitoring & visualization** with Prometheus and Grafana.
- **CI/CD pipeline** implemented using GitHub Actions.
