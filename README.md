# 🪐 Astronomy Shop – DevOps Observability Demo

This is my fork and implementation of the **Astronomy Shop** demo, adapted from the OpenTelemetry demo project.  
It showcases a **microservice-based application** with full observability setup, built to practice **DevOps concepts** like CI/CD, containerization, and monitoring.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

- Hands-on learning project for **DevOps and Observability**.
- Demonstrates **tracing, metrics, and logging** in a microservices environment.
- Implements **Docker, Kubernetes**, and **OpenTelemetry** integrations.


---

## ⚙️ Features

- Multi-service microservice architecture simulating an online shop.
- Instrumented with **OpenTelemetry** for monitoring and tracing.
- Dockerized services for local testing.
- Kubernetes manifests for cluster deployment.
- Observability stack using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.
- CI/CD pipeline implemented using **GitHub Actions**.
